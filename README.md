# HMI Evaluation Framework
This repository is devoted to contain the results of the research in the field of quantitative evaluation for the design of advanced HMI systems.

## The ANDROIDS project
The research is framed into the AutoNomous DiscoveRy Of depressIve Disorder Signs (ANDROIDS)project, which is funded by Università della Campania "Luigi Vanvitelli" by means of the V:alere funding programme. The project investigates the core features of human interactions to model cognitive and emotional processes. The aim is to design and implement autonomous systems and algorithms to detect early signs of mood changes and depressions through the analyses of interaction exchanges. ANDROIDS aims to combine diverse sources of information as well as to understand psychological dynamics from behavioural data.

## Long-term objective
In the context of the ANDROIDS project, this research has the long term goal to define and implement a framework for the design and the quantitative evaluation of HMIs in next generation smart and emotionally-aware virtual agents. To this aim, the main steps of the roadmap to accomplishing the research are:
